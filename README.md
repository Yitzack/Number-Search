Search for a self-referential number
James Grime of signingbanana on Youtube and Twitter asked his audience to find a self-referential number. I thought about matrices and finding eigenvector soltions and decided that matrix couldn't be made that would discibe self-referential. I thought it might be logiced. But beyond the first digit not being 0 by proof by contradiction, I wasn't coming up with anything with any speed. So I wrote this in response.
